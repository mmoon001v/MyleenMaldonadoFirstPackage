This Rmarkdown file will do the analysis.

```{r}
library(MyleenMaldonadoFirstPackage)   # load TestPackage, which includes MaxTemp data frame.
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(MaxTemp, aes(x=Date, y=MaxTemp)) +
  geom_line()
```

We see that the daily max temperature in Flagstaff varies quite a lot.
